//other types of graph:
// 5.Complete graph - > (A complete graph is a type of graph in which there is an edge between every pair of distinct values).
// 6.Disconnected Graph - > forest graph ->(A disconnected graph in which not all pairs of verties are connected by a path).
// 7.Euler graph - >(Every vertex in the graph must have an even degree).
// 8.Hamiltonian Graph - > (Graph in which visits every vertices exactly once and return to the starting index).
// 9.Cyclic - >(Contains at least one cycle means path started and end at the same vertex).
// 10.Acyclic - > (A graph that does not contain any cycle).
